### **HUE Vision: Browser-Based Eye Tracking with TensorFlow.js and MediaPipe FaceMesh**

**HUE Vision** is a web-based application that brings real-time eye tracking and gaze prediction directly into the browser - powered by **TensorFlow.js** and **MediaPipe FaceMesh**.
It showcases how on-device computer vision and machine learning can work seamlessly together for intuitive, privacy-friendly gaze interaction.

#### **Features**

* Real-time eye tracking using webcam input
* Lightweight facial landmark detection via **MediaPipe FaceMesh** (replacing clmtrackr)
* On-device machine learning model for gaze prediction using **TensorFlow.js**
* Live heatmap visualization to evaluate gaze prediction accuracy
* Clean, modern overlay with subtle facial mesh rendering and eye focus tracking
* Fully privacy-preserving - no data leaves your browser

#### **Technologies Used**

* **JavaScript** (ES6)
* **TensorFlow.js**
* **MediaPipe FaceMesh**
* **HTML5 / CSS3**
* **jQuery**

#### **How to Use**

1. Allow webcam access and center your face within the frame.
2. Start the **Calibration** process to map gaze positions.
3. Begin **Training** â€” the model learns your eye-to-screen relationship.
4. Once trained, enable **Tracking** to predict gaze movement in real time.
5. View the **Heatmap** to visualize gaze concentration and model accuracy.
